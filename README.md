# How to run code
All that is needed to do to run the code is open console and type python main.py. Once you do this the models SVM and linearReg will run and train those models. The other models such as NN and logisticReg were not working on my end of the computer however I was told that they did. Once you run python main.py, you will get outputs of MSE for the models then you will be prompted to enter hotel information. Here the all that is needed is to follow the instructions provided in the console.
